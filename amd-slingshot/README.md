## Final PPT Structure (AMD-first)
The presentation in `ppt-submission/` follows a 7-slide structure:
1. Team Details
2. Problem Statement
3. Proposed Solution
4. Architecture
5. Tech Stack
6. Novelty
7. Impacts and Benefits

## AMD Highlighting Principle
All pitch materials prioritize AMD as the core enabler:
- AMD Ryzen AI NPU (XDNA) as the inference engine
- On-device AI for privacy and zero cloud dependency
- Chrome extension used as deployment platform, not the hero
