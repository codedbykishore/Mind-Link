### CHART 2: Market Size — Horizontal Bar Chart
**Type:** Horizontal bar chart (sorted descending by magnitude)

**Data:**

| Metric | Value | Bar Color |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Annual phishing losses (US) | **$10.3B** | Red |
| Elderly internet users globally (65+) | **500M** | Orange |
| FTC subscription complaints (2024) | **2.6M** | Yellow |
| Phishing sites created daily | **47,000** | Dark Red |
| Chrome browser market share | **65%** | Blue |
| Users who read T&C before accepting | **7%** | Gray |
| On-device AI security tools available | **0** | Black |

**Design note:** Make the "$10.3B" bar dramatically longer than all others. End with the "0" bar as a tiny sliver — that's the gap we fill.
