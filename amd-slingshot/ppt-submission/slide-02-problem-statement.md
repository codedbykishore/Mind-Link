## The Crisis — Three Interconnected Threats

### Threat 1: Phishing Attacks Are Getting Smarter
- AI-generated phishing sites now fool even technically-savvy users
- **300% increase** in AI-crafted phishing pages since 2023
- Traditional blocklists go stale within hours — static databases can't keep up
- **95% of phishing attempts** target human psychology, not just technology

### Threat 2: Hidden Subscription Traps in Plain Sight
- **93% of users** click "I Agree" without reading Terms & Conditions
- Average T&C document: **5,000+ words** of deliberate legal obfuscation
- auto-renewals, cancellation traps, and non-refundable clauses buried inside
- FTC received **2.6 million subscription complaints** in 2024 alone

### Threat 3: Malicious Ads Fund Cybercrime
- **Malvertising** injects malware through legitimate-looking ad networks
- Fake download buttons trick users into installing trojans
- Static ad blocklists can't adapt to new ad formats or domain-hijacking
