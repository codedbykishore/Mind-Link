AI + Cybersecurity & Privacy

Essence: Safer digital experiences for students and institutions—simple, explainable, effective.

Why it matters: Phishing, malware, and data misuse hit learners hard; guardrails protect trust.

    Exploration paths:
    Early-warning and teach-back for phishing/malware with plain-language guidance.
    Privacy-preserving analytics for labs/classrooms (no raw PII exposure).
    Consent-first identity/fraud signals; secure access flows for clubs and labs.
    Explainable security so users understand risks and actions.
    Starter “digital hygiene” companions for first-year students.
