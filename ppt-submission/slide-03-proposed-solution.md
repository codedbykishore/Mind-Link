## PhishGuard Vision — Your On-Device AI Security Guardian

> **One install. Zero configuration. Automatic, private, always-on protection.**
> Everything Ananya needed — but nobody built until now.

## How It Works in 3 Seconds

```
You visit a website
       │
       ▼
AMD Ryzen AI NPU runs on-device analysis
       │
       ├── Is this site a phishing trap?        → Warning banner in your language
       ├── Are the Terms hiding fees?           → 4 plain-language bullet points
       └── Are there malicious ads?             → Blocked before they load
```

**No internet connection required. No data sent anywhere. Just AMD silicon doing the work.**

## Six Features, One Shield

| # | Feature | What It Does | AMD Hardware Role |
|---|---------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | **3-Tier Phishing Detection** | Domain scan → text scan → visual screenshot analysis | AMD NPU runs the AI inference for each tier |
| 2 | **Hidden Fee Detector** | 5,000-word T&C → 4 bullet warnings in 15 seconds | AMD NPU accelerates the 3-stage AI pipeline |
| 3 | **AI-Learned Ad Blocker** | Learns ad patterns dynamically from page DOM | AMD NPU powers pattern recognition |
| 4 | **Multi-Language Warnings** | Threats explained in 10 languages automatically | On-device translation via AMD NPU |
| 5 | **Jargon Simplifier** | Select any complex text → plain language in one keystroke | AMD NPU inference on selected text |
| 6 | **Dictionary Lookup** | Select any word → AI-powered plain definition | AMD NPU generates context-aware definitions |

## The Three Moments That Matter

### Moment 1: Ananya clicks a phishing link
```
"paypa1.com" loads
→ AMD NPU analyzes domain pattern (0.5 seconds)
→ Screenshot captured, logo analyzed for forgery
→ BIG RED BANNER: "This site is pretending to be PayPal. Close it now."
→ Ananya is safe.
```

### Moment 2: A student signs up for a "$1 antivirus trial"
```
Terms & Conditions page loads (5,000 words)
→ AMD NPU runs Summarizer: 5000 words → 200 words (3 seconds)
→ AMD NPU runs Rewriter: legal jargon → plain language (2 seconds)
→ AMD NPU runs Prompt AI: extracts hidden fees (4 seconds)
→ WARNING: "$1 trial auto-renews at $99.99/month. Cancel 7 days before — or pay $600"
→ Student declines. Saves $1,188/year.
```

### Moment 3: A student on a lab computer visits an ad-heavy site
```
Page loads with 47 potential ad elements
→ AMD NPU analyzes DOM structure
→ AI learns site-specific ad patterns
→ 47 ads removed. Malvertising blocked. Site loads clean.
```

## CHART: User Journey Before vs. After
**Type:** Side-by-side comparison cards

| Scenario | WITHOUT PhishGuard | WITH PhishGuard |
|----------|--------------------|----------------|
| Phishing site | Victim loses ₹2.4L | Warning in 2 seconds |
| T&C reading | 25 minutes (most skip) | 15 seconds, 4 bullets |
| Annual security cost | $60-140/year | $0 |
| Data privacy | Sent to security vendor cloud | Never leaves device |
| Languages supported | English only | 10 languages |
