# SLIDE 02 — Brief About the Idea

## The Problem

- **$10 Billion+** lost to phishing scams annually in the US alone
- Elderly users (65+) and students are the most targeted demographics
- Existing security tools require cloud APIs, subscriptions, and technical expertise
- **93% of users** never read Terms & Conditions — predatory fees go unnoticed
- 5,000+ word legal documents hide auto-renewals, cancellation traps, and hidden costs
