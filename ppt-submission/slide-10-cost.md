### CHART 11: Annual Cost Comparison — Bar Chart
**Type:** Vertical bar chart (one bar per solution)

**Data:**

| Solution | Annual Cost/User | Cloud Dependency | Privacy Score | Color |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| **PhishGuard Vision** | **$0** | None | 100% | Green |
| Malwarebytes Browser Guard | $0 (limited) | Partial | 60% | Light Gray |
| Bitdefender TrafficLight | $35.88/yr | Full cloud | 40% | Gray |
| McAfee WebAdvisor | $47.88/yr | Full cloud | 35% | Dark Gray |
| Norton Safe Web | $59.88/yr | Full cloud | 30% | Red |
| Kaspersky Safe Browsing | $71.88/yr | Full cloud | 25% | Dark Red |

**Design:** Our bar is at 0 (technically invisible — use a tiny green bar with a "$0" label). All competitors tower above. Add a dotted line at $50/yr labeled "Average competitor cost."

**Callout:** `"Every competitor charges you money to send your data to their cloud. We charge nothing and keep your data on your device."`

### CHART 12: Scalability — Line Chart (The Flat Line That Wins)
**Type:** Line chart — X axis: users, Y axis: monthly cost

**Data:**

| Users | PhishGuard ($/mo) | Cloud Solution A ($/mo) | Cloud Solution B ($/mo) |
|-------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 100 | $0 | $50 | $30 |
| 1,000 | $0 | $500 | $300 |
| 10,000 | $0 | $5,000 | $3,000 |
| 100,000 | $0 | $50,000 | $30,000 |
| 1,000,000 | $0 | $500,000 | $300,000 |
| 10,000,000 | $0 | $5,000,000 | $3,000,000 |

**Design:**
- **Our line:** Perfectly flat at $0 along the X axis — bright green, thick line
- **Cloud A (Norton-like):** Exponential curve shooting up — red
- **Cloud B (McAfee-like):** Similar exponential — orange
- **Label at 10M users:** `"$5M/month vs. $0/month"`

**This is the most dramatic chart in the deck.** The flat green line at zero while competitors skyrocket is an instantly compelling visual.
